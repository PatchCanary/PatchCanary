# Apate

Monitor insertion using [Solder](https://github.com/RiS3-Lab/Solder). The framework will instrument patches with monitoring functions to detect if (internal) resources are potentially being targeted. 

We will be able to observe their behavior and get a characterization of them and what they seem to be interested in.

## Components
TODO. 

### Name
